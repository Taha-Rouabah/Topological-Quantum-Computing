Pseudo-codes for weavescalculator.py
************************************

Initializations:

*We define the constant phi
*We define the sigma 1 and 2 matrices (called s1 and s2)
*We define the +-2 and +-4 powers of sigma 1 and 2
	these are contained in lists of 4 elements (s1List and s2List)

-------------------------------------------------

weaveMatrix(weave, s):
	We start with the identity
	
	Multipy it by the sigma matrices with the powers contained
	in 'weave' starting with sigma_'s'
	
	Return the result

squareMod(x):
	The square of the module of x.

traceNorm(W, U):
	returns the error as defined in Field and Simula
