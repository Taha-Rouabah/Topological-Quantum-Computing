newSeq(x, length): (example: x = [0,2,-4])
	increase the left-most element of 'x' by +2
	if this element is equal to +4:
		set this element to -4 and increase the next one
	if this element is equal to 0:
		set it to -4
		(0 represents an empty element)
	(the result will be x = [0,2,-2])


checkSeq(x, length):
	returns the sum of the elements of x (abs. values)

generatePosSeqList(length):
	start with a list = [0,...,0,0] of length = 'length'/2
	generate the next sequence with newSeq()
	save it
	repeat until you reach [4,...,4,4]

generateSeqList(length):
	returns the sequence generated with generatePosSeqList()
	 + the same sequence multiplied by -1

timedGeneration(length):
	same as generateSeqList() but with a timer
