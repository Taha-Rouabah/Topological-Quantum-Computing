# Single-qubit Braiding Gate

This repository contains python 3 codes for the implementation of a single-qubit braiding gate using FIbonacci anyons to approximate the Hadamard quantum gate to a given accuracy.
The qunatum information is encoded in a three-anyons qubit and computed by braiding those anyons onle yielding to a leakage free braiding gate.

The programs set prepared by Nacer Eddine Belaloui allows to manipulate three anyons qubit in order to construct the braid that approximate the best the Hadamard gate using a brut force search

Results of those codes have been presented in a study by Mohamed Taha Rouabah in collaboration with Nacer Eddine Belaloui and Abdellah Tounis: 	[arXiv:2008.03542](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343568268_Compiling_single-qubit_braiding_gate_for_Fibonacci_anyons_topological_quantum_computation)
