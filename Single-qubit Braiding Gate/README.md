Single-qubit Braiding Gate

This repository contains python 3 codes for the implementation of a single-qubit braiding gate using FIbonacci anyons to approximate the Hadamard quantum gate to a given accuracy.
The qunatum information is encoded in a thre-anyons qubit and computed by braiding those anyons onle yielding to a leakage free braiding gate.

The programs set allows to manipulate three anyons qubit in order to construct the braid that approximate the best the Hadamard gate using a brut force search

This codes have been used in the study reported in: 	arXiv:2008.03542 \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03542#:~:text=Topological%20quantum%20computation%20is%20an,way%20that%20radically%20reduces%20decoherence.&text=A%20single-qubit%20braiding%20gate,a%20brute%20force%20search%20method.}
