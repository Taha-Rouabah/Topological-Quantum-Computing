Single-qubit Braiding Gate

This repository contains python 3 codes for the implementation of a single-qubit braiding gate using FIbonacci anyons to approximate the Hadamard quantum gate to a given accuracy.
The qunatum information is encoded in a thre-anyons qubit and computed by braiding those anyons onle yielding to a leakage free braiding gate.
