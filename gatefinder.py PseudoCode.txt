Algorithms for gatefinder.py
****************************

Define the target gate's hermitian adjoint (for technical reasons)

Load the weaves library (made with braidgenerator.py)
or compute them in the script

Compute the matrix for each weave

Compute the distance between W and U using traceNorm() (for sigma 1 and 2)
	if this distance is shorter than the previous one:
		save this weave as the best weave
Do the same for every weave

----------------------------

In the end we're left with the best weave in the weaves library
